# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis 

Help AutosRUs review the production data for insights that may help the production team with the MechaCar.

## Overview

1. Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of the MechaCar prototypes.
2. Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots.
3. Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population
4. Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers. For each statistical analysis, youâ€™ll write a summary interpretation of the findings.

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

The following image shows coefficients that were found by using Rscript on the dataset as well as a summary of the linear regression.

The distribution shows that the dataset fits within normal parameters, and we can answer the questions below.

1. Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
  - Vehicle length and ground clearance represent non-random amounts of variance as applied to the MPG values.
2. Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
  - The slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero since the p-value of 5.35e-11 is far lower than the barometer of .05.  Since this is the case, the null hypothesis must be rejected and the relationship to MPG is affected by more than randomness.
